 * Heap http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)
 * 
 * -Notes-
 * 
 * This is Okasaki's Leftist Heap implemetation that satisfies two properties:
 *
 *   1. Heap-ordered propery: value(node) <= value(node.left) and also
 *                            value(node) <= value(node.right)
 *
 *   2. Leftist property: rank(node.left) >= rank(node.right)
 *
 * , where the 'rank' is rightmost spine (rightmost path from the root to 
 * an empty node) of the heap. Combining these proprties together, we can
 * guarantee at most O(log n) running time for insert/remove operations of
 * this heap.
 *
 * The heart of this implementation is 'merge' function that merges two given
 * heaps in logarithmic time, which is incredible performance. So, leftist heaps
 * are beautiful in terms of fast merging. The typical use case for such heaps - 
 * functional map/reduce algorithms where the final result is gathering from
 * the pieces by merging them. The 'merge' function can be treated as merging
 * two sorted lists (since the values in the right spine are always sorted).

   *
   * The 'insert' function might be defined through the 'Heap.merge' function, like
   *
   *   insert(x) = Heap.merge(this, Heap.make(x))
   *
   * We also can define the 'insert' function directly rather then calling merge
   * function. But the new function should also work in O(log n) time. This is the
   * main restriction.
   *
   * Tha main idea behind this function is that we can safely insert new node into
   * the right sub-heap until it's rank less then it's left sibling. Otherwise,
   * we have to _fill_ the left sub-heap enough to have it rank increased. This
   * approach gives us a complete heap as output, instead of unbalanced in case
   * of pure leftist heaps. 
   * 
   * Building the heap with such algorithm guarantees logarithmic running time
   * for custom queries on the heap's shape. This is not a popular scenarion,
   * but it might be usful for some problems.
