 * Bubble Sort http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
 *
 * Worst - O(n^2)
 * Best - O(n)
 * Average - O(n^2)
 *
 * -Notes-
 *
 * This is a functional implementation of standard bubble sort. There are two lists which represent
 * source and result lists correspondingly. So, the 'bubble' function performs element-wise swaps and
 * bubbles the greater element to the last position in the source list. This element should be transferred
 * to the head of result list (which is Nil by default). The interesting thing here is that source list
 * was reversed and we have to reverse it back to origin order. But, we didn't do that, since we don't 
 * care about source data which is still unsorted. We only have to keep sorted data in a right order.
 *
 * Thus this implementation fits into standard requirements about performance. Also, it works in O(n)
 * for lists which are already sorted.
